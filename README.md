## Intro DMP Tool

The [DMP Tool](https://dmptool.org/) is a product of the Digital Public Library of California designed to help scientists create Data Management Plans. The tool guides the user through the requirements and guidelines set out by the funders, offers suggestions, and allows institutions and repositories to offer their own suggestions. 
The [Quick Start Guide](https://dmptool.org/quickstartguide/) is an excellent documentation of how to use the product, including how to log in with your WHOI log in credentials. 

## Coolest Features

DMP Tool gives users the ability to save and come back to their work, export the document in several formats, add collaborators from other institutions, and control privacy of each document at every state. Creative users can also use it to store examples of DMPs that they want to share with lab mates, collaboratively develop protocol, or preserve DMPs from successful proposals for review.

DMP Tool administrators have the ability to create and customize templates to offer to departments and groups to use the same template.
